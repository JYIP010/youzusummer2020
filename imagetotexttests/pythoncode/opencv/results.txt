“Come Join Us”

y
We invite Primary 5 and Primary 6 pupils and their families to our open house on i
13 April 2019 from 9 a.m. to4p.m. This will be a fantastic opportunity to find out
more about us. You will have an opportunity io talk with our staff members and

students about ihe school and discover for yourself why Shakesphere Secondary
School is an excellent choice for you!

Our History

Shakesphere Secondary School was founded in 1930.
The founding of the school was made possible by the
philanthropist and businessman, Mr Khoo Lee.

 

 

 

Mr Khoo was born to a poor family. Although he did not have much education, he was diligent
when he worked as a clerk. As a result, he was promoted rapidly. He accumulated much
- savings because of his thrift. He then used this to start a business. His business thrived and he
was soon one of the richest businessmen in Singapore. Despite his wealth, he remained frugal.
However, he was generous to the underprivileged. He financially supported a number of
charitable causes but starting a school for the less fortunate was Mr Khoo’s biggest dream.
Because he had experienced poverty as a chila. he could empathise with these parents as they
tried to provide their children with an education. Hence, in 1930, he single-handedly contributed
to the building of a school for the poor and provided them with free education.

Realising the importance of being bilingual, Mr Khoo set up a school
that taught both English and Chinese. It was one of the pioneering
school to offer a bilingual Chinese-English programme in Singapore.

  

Today, Shakesphere Secondary School takes in students from all walks
of life. It takes pride in its illustrious bilingual alumni who have made their mark in various fields.

- savings because of his thrift. He then used this to start a business. His business thrived and he
was soon one of the richest businessmen in Singapore. Despite his wealth, he remained frugal.
However, he was generous to the underprivileged. He financially supported a number of
charitable causes but starting a school for the less fortunate was Mr Khoo’s biggest dream.
Because he had experienced poverty as a chila. he could empathise with these parents as they
tried to provide their children with an education. Hence, in 1930, he single-handedly contributed
to the building of a school for the poor and provided them with free education.

Realising the importance of being bilingual, Mr Khoo set up a school
that taught both English and Chinese. It was one of the pioneering
school to offer a bilingual Chinese-English programme in Singapore.

  

Today, Shakesphere Secondary School takes in students from all walks

Our History

Shakesphere Secondary School was founded in 1930.
The founding of the school was made possible by the
philanthropist and businessman, Mr Khoo Lee.

 

 

 

Mr Khoo was born to a poor family. Although he did not have much education, he was diligent
when he worked as a clerk. As a result, he was promoted rapidly. He accumulated much
- savings because of his thrift. He then used this to start a business. His business thrived and he
was soon one of the richest businessmen in Singapore. Despite his wealth, he remained frugal.
However, he was generous to the underprivileged. He financially supported a number of
charitable causes but starting a school for the less fortunate was Mr Khoo’s biggest dream.
Because he had experienced poverty as a chila. he could empathise with these parents as they
tried to provide their children with an education. Hence, in 1930, he single-handedly contributed
to the building of a school for the poor and provided them with free education.

Realising the importance of being bilingual, Mr Khoo set up a school

school to offer a bilingual Chinese-English programme in Singapore.

  

Today, Shakesphere Secondary School takes in students from all walks

“Come Join Us”

y
We invite Primary 5 and Primary 6 pupils and their families to our open house on i
13 April 2019 from 9 a.m. to4p.m. This will be a fantastic opportunity to find out
more about us. You will have an opportunity io talk with our staff members and

students about ihe school and discover for yourself why Shakesphere Secondary
School is an excellent choice for you!

Our History

Shakesphere Secondary School was founded in 1930.
The founding of the school was made possible by the
philanthropist and businessman, Mr Khoo Lee.

 

 

 

Mr Khoo was born to a poor family. Although he did not have much education, he was diligent
when he worked as a clerk. As a result, he was promoted rapidly. He accumulated much
- savings because of his thrift. He then used this to start a business. His business thrived and he
was soon one of the richest businessmen in Singapore. Despite his wealth, he remained frugal.
However, he was generous to the underprivileged. He financially supported a number of
charitable causes but starting a school for the less fortunate was Mr Khoo’s biggest dream.
Because he had experienced poverty as a chila. he could empathise with these parents as they
tried to provide their children with an education. Hence, in 1930, he single-handedly contributed
to the building of a school for the poor and provided them with free education.

Realising the importance of being bilingual, Mr Khoo set up a school
that taught both English and Chinese. It was one of the pioneering
school to offer a bilingual Chinese-English programme in Singapore.

  

Today, Shakesphere Secondary School takes in students from all walks
of life. It takes pride in its illustrious bilingual alumni who have made their mark in various fields.

“Come Join Us”

y
We invite Primary 5 and Primary 6 pupils and their families to our open house on i
13 April 2019 from 9 a.m. to4p.m. This will be a fantastic opportunity to find out
more about us. You will have an opportunity io talk with our staff members and

students about ihe school and discover for yourself why Shakesphere Secondary
School is an excellent choice for you!

Our History

Shakesphere Secondary School was founded in 1930.
The founding of the school was made possible by the
philanthropist and businessman, Mr Khoo Lee.

 

 

 

Mr Khoo was born to a poor family. Although he did not have much education, he was diligent
when he worked as a clerk. As a result, he was promoted rapidly. He accumulated much
- savings because of his thrift. He then used this to start a business. His business thrived and he
was soon one of the richest businessmen in Singapore. Despite his wealth, he remained frugal.
However, he was generous to the underprivileged. He financially supported a number of
charitable causes but starting a school for the less fortunate was Mr Khoo’s biggest dream.
Because he had experienced poverty as a chila. he could empathise with these parents as they
tried to provide their children with an education. Hence, in 1930, he single-handedly contributed
to the building of a school for the poor and provided them with free education.

Realising the importance of being bilingual, Mr Khoo set up a school
that taught both English and Chinese. It was one of the pioneering
school to offer a bilingual Chinese-English programme in Singapore.

  

Today, Shakesphere Secondary School takes in students from all walks
of life. It takes pride in its illustrious bilingual alumni who have made their mark in various fields.
