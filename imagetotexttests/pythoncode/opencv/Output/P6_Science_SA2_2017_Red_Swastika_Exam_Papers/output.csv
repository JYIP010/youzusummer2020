difference in the duration the flewers remain fresh is dué to the
: use of ‘simply fresh’? which is the only variable.(i) Water vapour is given out by the piants through the opening.
When the water vapour comes inte contact with the cooler
inner surface of the plastic bag, it loses heat and condenses to
form water droplets on the plastic bag.Q32 (b) :

BD - A,C(i) «=. Phe son reduces the amount of sunlight entering the water.
As a result, the plants photosynthesize less and produced less
oxygen.O34 (a) ContainerQ34 (b) Carbon dioxide is needed for paotosynthesis. Guppies breath out
carbon dioxide therefore when there is more carbon dioxide, the
plant would photosynthesise more. Producing more bubbles which
have oxygen in it.Ahscon’s sonQ36 (a) More water was collected in container X as the amount of water
yapours that lest heat and condensed on plate A is more. This
shows that plate A is a better conductor of heat than plate B.O36 (b) Only liquid can evaporate, solid ike the blue dye powder can't
therefore when liquid Q gained heat from the buasen burner and
evaporated it was colourless as the powder could not evaporate with
the liquid.Q37) Andy cenld on the heater’s temperature Delow substance B’s melting pomt
so when substance B melts finish, Andy could pour it away. Andy could
then put the empty container on standby so when substance A finish

. melting, it could pour it into the empty container.Q38 (a)

voQ38 (b) Surface Q. The distance moved by the box ts the least. i bere is the
most friction between the box and the surface and can prevent the
user from slipping.O39 (a) ~~ SeriesQ39 (b) When the cireuit is closed, the Iron rod became magnetised and
attracts the steel plate which is a magnetic materia}. This results in
the striker hitting the bell.Q39 (c} Property 1: Object'X isa non-magnetic material.
Property 2: Object Xisa coiiductor of electricity.O40 (c) When the nichrome wireis:keated, fhe air surrounding the wire ts
heated. Air expands when Keated and pushes the paper as the air
takes up more space.Q40 (d) Yes. There will be less electrical energy to heat the nichrome wire.
The surrounding air will expand less, reducing the speed of the
paper. -Q41 (a)  Container'A is made out of a poor conductor of heat and container
Bis made out of a good conductor of heat.Q41 (b) Container B. It allows more heat to flow from the surrounding air
to the container. The ice gains heat and melts more quickly. This
will not keep the fish fresh.",;TempImages/89.jpg;TempImages/88.jpg;TempImages/92.jpg;TempImages/91.jpg;TempImages/90.jpg;TempImages/93.jpg;TempImages/95.jpg;TempImages/94.jpg;TempImages/96.jpg
