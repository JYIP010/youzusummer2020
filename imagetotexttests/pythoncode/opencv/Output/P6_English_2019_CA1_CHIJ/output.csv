gave me a palette of watercolour and that unleashed the magic of creative expressions in me. At

a memorable scene tome book | had read or even the banana | had for afternoon snack. As a
result, my paintings did not tell a story. Then, | became more accomplished with practiceOnce, we
went on a vacation to another country and Dad said that my colourful painting of a garden we visiied
