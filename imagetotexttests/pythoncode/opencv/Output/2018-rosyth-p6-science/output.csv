lose the water, and the mass of it.Q30a) It has natr.Q30d) The temperature of hot water in set-up B was cooler than that of set-up A at the
end of the experiment. This shows that water is a better conductor of heat than air. So by
putting its feet about water, it will lose heat to the water at a slower rate, allowing P to
keep itself warm.Q31a) The flowers will be more visible to animal pollinators if above water, allowing
pollination to occur more frequently.Q316) Ovule, Fertilisation.Qsitc) To help disperse the seeds.Q32b) No. Cylinder B is a control set-up that will confirm that the only variable affecting
the colour of the liquid Y is the occurrence of photosynthesis.Q33a) Y. It shows that the percentage of undigested food that left the mouth and gullet
remained the same. Digestion does not occur in the gullet, hence Y is correct.Q33b) stomacn.Qs53c) The insect will be digested and broken down Into simpler substances and then
absorbed by the small intestines into the bloodstream.The eggs will be passed Into the large Intestines and then passed out along with
the bird droppings as they are not digestible.Q53d) Migration helps to disperse the eggs fo further places, ensuring more space
covered. This gives the eggs more food to survive.Q35a) Material C. Material C showed it reflected the most amount of light from the
furthest distance. This is ideal because it means that drivers can notice the reflected
lights from far away and this will ensure better road safety.Q36a) Set-ups L and MQ36b) By choosing both set-ups, the only variable affecting the result is the surface area
of the block in contact with A. The exposed surface areas are covered with a poor
conductor of heat to ensure most heat gain is largely due to the surface area in contact
with A. This perfectly represents the objective.Q36c) RubberQ38b) Bulbs B2 and B3Q40a) MagnetQ40b) Base X is a magnet with its like poles facing the magnet. Since like poles repel,
base X was repelled by the magnet plate, and the magnetic force is stronger than the
gravitational pull, allowing the table to float.Q40c) When 150kg is added to the table, the magnetic force is unable to overcome the
gravitational pull as the gravitational force has increased due to additional mass.",TempImages/86.jpg;TempImages/85.jpg;TempImages/87.jpg;TempImages/89.jpg;TempImages/88.jpg;TempImages/90.jpg
