/ . Predator : F mo . .

a . b)2006t0 2007, oe aec)G also needs water to respire and carry out life processes so
without water, G dies. As the population size of G decreases, lesser
food is available for F, so the population size of F also decreases.

Q32) | a)i)The type of soil they are buried in.

ii)The depth of the hole, the boxes are buried. :

b)Plastic remain as waste in our environment.
c)Use lesser things made from plastic. Instead, use recyclable
materials such as cloth bags instead of plastic bags.

Q33) a)Structural adaptation : B has clawed feet that help it climb around
the beehives easily. :
Behavioural adaptation : B mimics the scent of bees in order to enter
the beehives to consume the honey.
b)During feeding at night, organism B will flash its brightly coloured
abdomen to frighten its predator away. The colours can be seen easily
at night. Thus, it will be safe to feed at night.
c)The bees would attack any intruder like B but the bees are fooled by
B’s mimicry of their scent so the bees think B is another bee and will
not attack. |

. d)The. population size of B would decrease. When the forest is cleared,
bees cannot build their beehives and not as many flowers can grow. B
will have lesser food and no shelter. ""
e)When deforestation happen, trees are cut down and lesser trees to
photosynthesize. When the rate of photosynthesis slows down, more
carbon dioxide is present in the air, More heat is trapped when there is
- | more carbon dioxide: Thus, causes global | warming. .

Q35)° | a)The time taken for the paper flyer A to reach the ground.

. b)The distarice travelled by A after the blades were trimmed would be .
shorter. There will be lesser air resistance between'the shorter blades
| and the air so gravitational force will overcome frictional force more
easily, thus A with shorter blades cannot travel as far.
! —| AR
a)Repeat the experiment a few.more times and take. the average
results. 2
b)A longer distance. The straws have air spaces between them, so the
new set-up has lesser friction between the floor and the toy, hence
lesser frictional force needs.to be overcome.
Q37) | a)The scale will still be balanced. ;

b)Air can be compressed.
¢)No, the balloon will not inflate. The water in the bottle has a definite
volume and:cannot be compressed or displaced by and air blown into

/ the balloon.

a)To find out different colour filters would affect the colour of light
produced. a .
b)The can is opaque and blocks more light than the translucent filter.
As light travels in. a straight line, the can will block the light in its path
and form a shadow. The filter.only partially blocks light so its shadow
is faint.

a)Water droplets.
b)Metal is a.good conductor of heat contact , so it would gain heat
from the surrounding water vapour faster to allow more water vapour |
to process condense into more water droplets so more water is
produced.
c)This is so the metal top has more surface area in contact with more
water vapour in the air so there will be a higher rate of condensation =|
and more water will be produced. ~

Q44) | a)t hour |

_ | b)At 12p.m.
c)As hot water leaves the water tank when Jia Ming is bathing, the
cold water will enter the water tank to fill up the space. It takes time for ,
the cold water to gain heat from the heating coil but cold water keeps
entering the tank when tap is on. So it will not reach 49° C instantly so
not so hotjas when he started. bathing.
d)B. B only takes 5 minutes to heat water up to 49°C whereas A takes
1 hour and the amount of heated water is finite. The water is heated up
. only when needed. .
