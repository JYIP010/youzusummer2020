School is an excellent choice for you!
Our History Ewa wa
SSSA POA LES
Shakesphere Secondary School was founded in 1930. eM Mele
The founding of the school was made possible by the See)
philanthropist and businessman, Mr Khoo Lee. a>
Mr Khoo was born to a poor family. Although he did not have much education, he was diligent
when he worked as a clerk. As a result, he was promoted rapidly. He accumulated much
- savings because of his thrift. He then used this to start a business. His business thrived and he
was soon one of the richest businessmen in Singapore. Despite his wealth, he remained frugal. |
However, he was generous to the underprivileged. He financially supported a number of
charitable causes but starting a school for the less fortunate was Mr Khoo’s biggest dream.
Because he had experienced poverty as a chila. he could empathise with these parents as they
tried to provide their children with an education. Hence, in 1930, he single-handedly contributed
to the building of a school for the poor and provided them with free education.
Realising the importance of being bilingual, Mr Khoo set up a school . lg
that taught both English and Chinese. tt was one of the pioneering aes. eal Bin oi
school to offer a bilingual Chinese-English programme in Singapore. ee ry ee
Today, Shakesphere Secondary School takes in students from all walks ae Aes
of life. It takes pride in its illustrious bilingual alumni who have made their mark in various fields.

“You will need ear plugs for your next patient,” Nurse Sim informed me, trying to keep a
straight face. The waming was not needed as | had already heard the wails of a child
resounding from the waiting room.
| watched as a worried-looking mother ushered a young girl of about six of age into my
room. Gesturing towards the chair next to my table, { invited the girl to sit down. ‘What's the 5
matter?” | enquired. “| got stung by a wasp,” she sobbed, holding up a finger. Taking a closer
look, | could indeed see a needleike object protruding from it. The flesh around the sting had
begun to swell an angry red. | took a deep breath. Removing it in one piece would not be easy
if my patient would not calm down and keep still. RacKing my brain for a solution, my gaze
came to rest on an old rubber toy sitting on my table. 10

That was when | was brought back to the day | visited the wet market with Grandma
when I was a kindergartener.

“Grandma, look! I've never seen such a big prawn before!” | pointed at a red creature
with whiskers and two big claws. | particularly found the claws fascinating - they reminded me
of excavators, my favourite machines. 15

“That's not a prawn, Ali!” Grandma chuckled. “Its a lobster. Its meat is very tasty, but
beware of the claws. They are really mean.” Grandma gave me a cautionary wink.

“The lobster was just flown in this morning from Australia. Would you like to buy it?” the

fishmonger promoted the “delicacy” to Grandma. While Grandma and the fishmonger engaged

in their animated chatter, ! decided to check out the lobster. It was in a Styrofoam box with 20
some water. The lobster stared at me with its bulging eyes. ! lifted my hand, wanting to touch
’ its hard shell. To my surprise. it scuttled back a couple of steps. inexplicably, | felt the stirring

of an urge. Despite its armoured exterior, the lobster was a coward after, all! Emboldened, j
stuck out my pointer finger at the lobster, intending to give it a jab.

An excruciating pain shot up my arm. Giving a loud yell, | jumped up with a start. Tears 25
stung my tightly shut eyes and my heart palpitated like a runaway train.

“Oh no! Someone, please help Ali” ! could hear Grandma’s anxious plea for
intervention. Opening my eyes just a fraction, | tried to focus on the source of my misery.
There, at the tip of my pointer finger, hung the lobster. We were connected finger to claw. It
was an amazing sight. Had | not been so overwhelmed with shock, | would have actually 30
laughed.

The fishmonger tried to pull the lobster off my finger. | screamed. “Use that chopper of
yours and chop off that claw,” Grandma ordered the fishmonger. “! can’t do that! Who would
buy a one-claw lobster? This lobster can fetch a good price!” By now, the housewives
browsing at the nearby stalls had gathered to watch the spectacle. 35

Grandma said calmly, “Here, | will pull Ali's finger. You pull the lobster. Together!” With
the concerted effort of Grandma and the fishmonger, they finally managed to get the offending
creature off.

Grandma washed my finger at a lap _at the stall and whipped out a plaster from her
purse. Gently, she put it on my sore finger. The fishmonger retrieved a dusty rubber toy from 40
an overhead sheif. “Squeeze it,” she said, smiling. | did as told and the toy squeaked.
Surprisingly, that made me feel better. The kindness of the fishmonger filled my heart.

“Doctor, can you help make me feel better?” | was jolted back to the present.

“| can't. But Squeaky can,” i said, presenting the toy to her. As my now composed
patient held on to Squeaky in her other hand, | set out to remove the sting. 45
